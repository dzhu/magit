* outstanding issues

** git-rebase-killed-action face says for exec

but only for action.  and maybe that makes sense given comment heading
below.

** TODO way to uncomment lines like exec and reset?

seems like can just pick them, but end up wrong

actually doesn't seem like you can pick them, only the types i've
introduced

desired behavior

- [X] if on different action and empty, ding
- [X] if on uncommented and empty, delete
- [X] if on uncommented with same, ding
- [X] if on commented and empty, uncomment
- [X] if on commented and same, uncomment
- [ ] if on different action, new line
